A modern, dynamic, and highly scalable Human Resource Management System (HRMS) built with architectural excellence.

**⚠️ Currently under active development**  
Core modules are being built using best practices including Vertical Slicing, CQRS, Redis Caching, and Clean Architecture.

## 🌟 Overview

This project is a master-level capstone HRMS designed for real-world enterprise use. It centralizes essential HR functionalities with a clean, modular architecture.

## 🎯 Purpose

Empower HR processes with a system that demonstrates:
- Clear module responsibilities
- Well-defined system flows
- Proper business logic separation
- Robust data access policies
- Effective domain modeling
